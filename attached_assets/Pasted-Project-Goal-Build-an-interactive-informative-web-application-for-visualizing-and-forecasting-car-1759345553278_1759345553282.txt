Project Goal:
Build an interactive, informative web application for visualizing and forecasting carbon emissions across different urban areas of Lahore, Pakistan. The app uses machine learning forecasts on area-wise, sectoral data (transport, industry, energy, waste, buildings), serving planners, policymakers, and the public.

Required Features:

Interactive Emission Map

Lahore city map divided by administrative areas.

Color-coded overlays and dynamic “hot spots” based on emission levels (selectable by sector and total).

User can select any area on the map or use filters to focus on specific sectors (transport, energy, etc.).

Timeframe and View Controls

User can select time interval: monthly, yearly, or a custom range within available data.

Toggle between historical emissions and machine learning-based forecasts.

Leaderboards & Area Comparison

A dynamic leaderboard ranking areas from highest to lowest emissions (with view by sector and by total).

Clicking a leaderboard entry zooms/toggles to that area on the map, showing detailed stats/trends.

Visualization Dashboard

Line/bar charts for emission trends by area, sector, or time.

Pie/stacked charts for sectoral shares in selected areas.

Clearly display both historic data and forecasts.

User Experience

Modern, attractive, and responsive layout (desktop/mobile).

Integrated tooltips/help for map, rankings, and controls.

Lahore branding/theme where appropriate.

/Tech Requirements:

Map visualization using Mapbox, Leaflet, or similar.

Charting via Chart.js, D3, Plotly, or similar.

Connects to backend API for data and forecasting results.

Fast filter/search/selection tools for users to explore data by area, time, or sector.

Sample User Flows:

User selects "Gulberg" and “Transportation,” sees current and future monthly emissions, with Gulberg highlighted on the map.

User sorts leaderboard to find “cleanest” versus “most polluting” area this year, clicks to zoom and compare.

Deliverable:
A full frontend solution enabling map-based hot spot visualization, emission trend forecasts (monthly/yearly views), sector filtering, and leaderboard comparisons for all urban areas of Lahore.
